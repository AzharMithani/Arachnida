Arachnida : simple web interface to pilot crawlers
=========

Scrap the web easily, without coding knowledge.
Arachnida is providing a simple web interface to pilot powerful crawlers (running Headless Chrome)

# Install (2 seconds) #
open a terminal, and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/guillim/meteor-starter-kit.git myapp  && cd myapp  && meteor
```

Finished !
Now have a look at it in google chrome, clicking on this link: http://localhost:3000
You will be able to add a crawler in 5 second, add a URL to scrap and run it ! 


## What's included ##
* See screenshot of your running crawler
* Manually add URL to be scrapped, or upload a CSV 
* Sign in / Sign up  
* Account management: Profile Page, Username, Change password, Delete account...
* Admin for the webmaster: go to `/admin`
* Router
* MongoDB as database

# Contribute #  

I am looking for people to make pull request to improve Arachnida. Please do it :)  
TO DO:  
1. Setup live queue of url to be scrapped (ex: at the moment, you can't click straignt on a link and scrap it)
2. Live Log from the server brought to the interface to help debuging
